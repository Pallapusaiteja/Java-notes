oops --> object oriented programming language.
There are four types:

1) ENCAPSULATION:-
   in this it uses mainly private keyword which implies other classes are not accesible and to acces this we need to use methods.
Methods are two types:
a)get() method--> It access the values.
b)set() method --> It assigns the values.
Ex: it is like when ever a person want a permission he needs to take permission ffrom that person.

2)INHERITAANCE:-
  in this it accepts the values from the parent class


Ex: a person accepts property or any wil from there parents. same way the child class accepts the values or any type from the parent class.
